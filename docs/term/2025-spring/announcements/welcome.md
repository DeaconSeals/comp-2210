# Welcome to COMP 2210 Spring!

This is a course in data structures and algorithms, and is one of the most
important foundational courses in the curriculum. It's also one of my favorite
courses to teach and I'm looking forward to this semester!  

The first lecture will be on *Tuesday, January 14* from 8:00 AM CT - 9:15 AM CT
in Foy 258 for all sections. **Labs do not meet the first week**, so the first
lab meeting will also meet *Tuesday, January 21* at the time and in the lab 
room assigned to the section for which you registered.

This is a combined lecture/lab course that meets for 150 minutes each week in
lecture and for 150 minutes each week in lab. There are many course sections that
all meet together for lecture but separately for lab. Be sure to check Tiger
Scheduler to confirm the course section for which you are registered, since
Canvas can make it appear (incorrectly) that everyone is in the same section of
the course.

I look forward to seeing you in lecture.

War Eagle!
