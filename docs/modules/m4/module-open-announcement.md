# Module 4 Announcements

We've reached the half-way point in the course modules, and I hope you're
finding the experience fun, challenging, and rewarding. Module 4 focuses on
**lists**, **stacks**, and **queues** - some of the most ubiquitous
collections used in problem solving. We will also be introduced to two new
solution patterns - **breadth-first** and **depth-first search**.

As a word of caution, Module 4 is the point where the difficulty of the course
seems to increase for many students, and time management will become more
important. To alleviate the difficulty of Assignment 4, in particular, I've
recorded a brief lecture with hints and guidance, linked below, that I
recommend watching ***after you read the assignment instructions***.

Module 4 also contains the second exam and second lab test. All exams and tests
in this course are to some extent comprehensive, since the course material
builds upon itself, but the second exam and lab test will focus on the material
covered in Module 3 and Module 4. There will be separate announcements for the
exam and lab test.

As you begin Module 4, here are a few things to keep in mind.

- Time management, as always, will be important. Be sure to set aside time each
  day to work on this course, and don’t try to get everything done in the one or
  two days before things are due.

- Although the module is laid out sequentially, it might be best to work through
  everything iteratively instead. I suggest starting with the lectures and
  lecture notes, and switching to a hands-on activities once that particular
  topic is covered in the notes. Likewise, once the material needed to complete
  the assignment has been covered in the lectures and you have completed the
  associated hands-on activities, start on the assignment. See the resource from
  Module 0 for a discussion of the suggested course workflow.

- An [active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning),
  [self-regulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-regulated_learning)
  approach to learning in this course is crucial to your success. The passive
  activities we typically associate with "studying" (attendance, reading,
  listening, watching) are necessary, but they are not sufficient. For example:
  Don't just read the notes, **do** the notes - actually implement in code the
  algorithms and partial code being presented. 

- As in each module, the assignment and all hands-on activities are due no later
  than 11:59 PM CT on the last day of the module.

Lots of good stuff in this module! Have fun, and please do reach out if you
have questions or concerns.
