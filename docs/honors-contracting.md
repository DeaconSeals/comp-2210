# Honors Contracting COMP 22210

If you are enrolled in the Honors College, you can contract this course for honors credit. To do this, you must first meet with me to determine an appropriate project and deliverables. Honors contracts must be submitted by the 15th day of classes and there are additional steps beyond my approving of the contract, so you are strongly encouraged to meet with me as early in the semester as possible. 

This project is meant to roughly emulate an engineering research project, albeit with standards appropriate for a sophomore-level data structures course. In other words, you are not expected to meet the standards of a peer-reviewed academic publication, but your project will be structured as a simplified version of the work that goes into such a publication. To that end, your project should be on a topic you find interesting and it doesn't have to be academically novel. This is a great opportunity to work on a passion project or pursue experience with something you haven't quite found the time to explore!

## Picking a Topic
There is a lot of flexibility when it comes to selecting an appropriate topic for honors contracting in this course. The primary requirements are as follows:
* you must have a significant software development component,
* you must gain experience with something new (for you),
* your topic should allow for some kind of quantitative or qualitative experimentation, and
* you should be able to find at least 2 peer-reviewed publications that somehow relate to your topic.

Additionally, it should be reasonable to complete your project by the end of the semester, though your honors contracting project could be a component of a larger project, so long as you satisfy the above criteria.

## Programming Languages
There are no restrictions to what programming languages you use (i.e., you are not required to use Java for your project). You are encouraged to use the programming language most appropriate for your project.

## Git
You are required to use GitHub or GitLab throughout development to manage your code. At the end of the semester, you will submit the repo containing your code alongside other deliverables. If your repo is public, you can simply share a link (some employers may be interested to see projects like this). If your repo is private, you can either invite me as a collaborator or download your repo from GitHub/GitLab as a zip file and submit this.

## Report
You must complete a 4+ page report resembling an academic publication including no fewer than 5 sources. Of these sources, 2 must be peer-reviewed (conference papers, journal articles, some books, etc.). Your sources must be referenced using parenthetical citations and included in the bibliography of your report. The report should include the following sections:
* Introduction
* Background and/or Related Work
* Methodology (containing implementation or experiment design details)
* Results (containing data on some sort of measurements collected from the completed project software)
* Conclusions
* Bibliography

## Mandatory Meetings and Deadlines
*Please note: you are responsible for emailing me to schedule mandatory meetings. When practical, please try to schedule these in advance.*
1. Within 2 weeks of approving your honors contract, you will perform a brief literature review and identify 2 peer-reviewed publications related to your project. These will serve as sources in your report, an example of the style of report you are to write, and (ideally) contain useful or interesting information related to your project. You must send me your 2 peer-reviewed publications and meet with me to discuss them.
1. Sometime during the 2 weeks of Module 4, you should meet with me to discuss mid-semester progress. This is an opportunity for you to get assistance/advice and you should be able to demonstrate that you've been using your GitHub/GitLab repo.
1. Sometime between the start of Module 6 and the start of finals week, you must meet with me and provide a debrief on how your project went. Your project doesn't necessarily need to be finished by this point and you can use this meeting to get help on any final obstacles holding you up. I want to know how your project went and what you would have done differently. You should have a significant draft of your report complete for us to discuss in this meeting.
1. Your complete project (including repo and report) is due via email on the middle day of finals week. If it's not clear what day that is, please ask. No meeting is required for this submission and you are welcome to submit earlier.

## Project Failure
If your project fails for some reason, that doesn't necessarily mean you fail for honors contracting. You are ideally exploring something new to you and there is room for you to learn, make mistakes, and attempt things that may end up being overambitious. Your critical analysis can provide tremendously valuable experience for your future endeavors, though some degree of effort is still required to learn when you encounter failure. However, the amount of effort you put into your project is very important to satisfying your honors contract in cases of failure.

The various meetings throughout the semester are designed to help you avoid project failure, so it's important that you utilize them effectively (i.e., show up and be able to demonstrate meaningful progress). If your project fails, change the results section of your report to discuss what failed and why it failed. Your conclusion section should heavily emphasize what could be done to address the failure in future attempts, as well as any components that didn't fail.


## Additional Things To Consider

### Instructor Background
You are by no means required to pick a topic within my area of expertise and you'll still receive mentorship, but in case you're interested in receiving mentorship on a particular topic outside the scope of this class, it may be beneficial for you to know a little about my background.

I am an AI researcher who specializes in competitive games with degrees in electrical engineering and computer engineering, in addition to computer science and software engineering. I also have a tremendous amount of experience with interdisciplinary projects involving mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, and subdisciplines of computer science including security, high performance computing, system administration, and user interface design. 

### Components of Previously Accepted Projects
Students from a diverse range of majors contract this course for honors credit (e.g., mechanical engineering, computer engineering, physics). To emphasize, I am very flexible with the topic of your project and this includes both interdisciplinary projects and those that fall within pure computer science. Here are some examples of components from previously accepted honors contracting projects (this is not an exhaustive list): 
* embedded development (using a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.)
* physical computing (using sensors, movement, etc.)
* advanced programming and use of external libraries
* robotics
* benchmarking
* system administration (communication between multiple computers)
* graphical user interface design
* games and game-playing programs
*Please note: in general, if your project required hardware, you are responsible for providing this. I am happy to help you pick out hardware though.*
